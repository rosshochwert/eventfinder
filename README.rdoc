== Introduction

Hi! This was the first app I ever made so be gentle. I used onmniauth to connect users to my app through Facebook and Bootstrap to make everything look nice. The app pulls all the events a user has been invited to and lists them in a nice table. I planned to include listings from EventBrite API but couldn't seem to get it working.

== Usage

Just sign in with Facebook and the app loads automatically. This was mostly me experimenting with API and Rails. In hindsight, it was probably a bad way to get started, but oh well!
